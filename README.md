# sudoku-solver

Using Backtracking, sudoku puzzle solving is efficiently done, 
Enter any valid sudoku puzzle and get the answer, 
if the page is unresponsive you may have entered invalid puzzle refresh and enter a valid sudoku again :)
If you dont enter anything the value of the cell is considered as zero so if you dont enter any value in any cell it assumes all zeroes and gives a valid answer....**
